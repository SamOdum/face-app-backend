# FaceApp-backend

## Project Overview

FaceApp is a fun little project I built with the PERN stack. It is an app that allow users
to register and or login, and to subsequently supply the app the URL of any image hosted
anywhere on the internet. The fun part is that the pp then tries to guess if a face is in the
given picture.

## Project Summary

This is a full stack project built with the PERN stact. It is hosted on Heroku.
